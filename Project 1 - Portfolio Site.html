        <h2><i>Catwoman</i> Comic Book Reviews</h2>
        <p class="series-description">Catwoman has long been a favorite character of mine, going all the way back to <i>Batman Returns</i>, <i>Batman: The Animated Series</i>, and the first <i>Catwoman</i> ongoing series by writers like Jo Duffy
        and Chuck Dixon with that classic Jim Balent artwork. This current series hasn't been great but anytime I'm buying comics and there's a <i>Catwoman</i> series, I'll be buying it!</p>

        <h2><i>Red Hood</i> Comic Book Reviews</h2>
        <p class="series-description">Jason Todd, the second Robin, killed by the Joker and resurrected by Ra's ah Ghul, reborn as Red Hood...  Jason is, to me, the most interesting of any of the characters that have held the 
            title of 'Robin' as his rage at Batman's failure to avenge his death and his willingness, even proclivity, to kill criminals puts him in stark contrast with Gotham's Dark Knight. <i>Red Hood: Outlaw</i>
            is a fantastic series and you shoudl definetly add it to your reading list!

        <h2><i>Detective Comics</i> Comic Book Reviews</h2>
        <p class="series-description"><i>Detective Comics</i>has long been one of DC Comics' flagship titles and deservedly so. Right now Peter Tomasi's run on this 80 year old title is one of the best in years, only matched by
        James Tynion's run back at the beginning of <i>DC Rebirth</i>. </p>
